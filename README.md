# odin-recipes
This is my new project! It's called 'odin recipes' During this project i'll be showing you my recently acquired HTML skills: 

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Links
- Images
- Bold and strong
- Italic and emphasized
- Ordered lists
- Unordered lists

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a my favorite recipes. The website wonâ€™t look very pretty.. yet..
